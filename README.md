Welcome to my personal repository
I'm Bennie Blunt, a technology enthusiast  in the field of Machine Learning Applied to Real Apps and Solutions This repository serves as a centralized hub for all my educational materials, projects, and notes. My motivation is to assist others in their learning journey by providing a well-organized collection of resources.  While my day job involves no use of AI/ML currently I plan to change that and this is my start to that end.  
In this repository I will document my journey and learnings back into of Machine Learning Applied to Real Apps and Solutions.   Here, you'll find a collection of documents, projects, references, cheat sheets and notes that I've accumulated since my first graduate ML course in 2010.  over time. The goal is to create a valuable resource that others might find informative and useful.  I will provide some insight of how and why I feel they have value according to my use cases.

**The repository is organized into the following sections:**
**Projects:** Real-world applications and hands-on projects. ====> [ Adding Soon ]
**Books, white papers Documents:** Reference documents, cheat sheets, and guides. ====> [ Adding Soon ]
**Helpful repositories**
